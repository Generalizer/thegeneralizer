#'Generate recruitment lists to achieve a target sample size.
#'
#'The input to this function must be the output of the \code{stratifer} function,
#'along with the sample size that the researcher aims to recruit (typically the
#'desired number of schools).
#'
#'As output, this function prints a table with columns equal to the number of
#'strata specified in \code{stratifier()} and three rows. The first row presents
#'the number of schools in the inference population that fall in each stratum. The
#'second row presents the proportion of the population in each stratum. Finally, the
#'third row contains the number of schools per stratum that the researcher should
#'aim to recruit in order to ensure that the proportions in their sample mirror
#'those in the population.
